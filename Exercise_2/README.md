A project for implementing 'Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer'

The Astronaut Daily Schedule Organizer is a console-based application designed to help astronauts manage their daily tasks. Users can add, remove, view, edit, and mark tasks as completed. Tasks are assigned priority levels and time slots, and the system ensures that no tasks overlap in timing. The application is built following best coding practices, incorporating design patterns such as the Singleton, Factory, and Observer patterns. It also provides comprehensive logging for tracking actions and handles exceptions gracefully.
